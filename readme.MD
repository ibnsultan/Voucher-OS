Vourcher OS is a simple hotspot and WiFi management system for controlling internet access using vouchers. It helps network owners create, manage, and track user access with time or data limits. OpenVoucher is suitable for schools, cafés, offices, and other shared networks where controlled and reliable WiFi access is needed.

It is based on [openvoucher ](https://github.com/litzinetz-de/OpenVoucher)project by [@litzinetz-de](https://github.com/litzinetz-de) and this is an attempt to modernize and improve the original codebase.
